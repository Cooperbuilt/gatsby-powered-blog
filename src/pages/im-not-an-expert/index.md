I’m not “senior”, at least not in any real definition. 

I’m ✌self taught✌. I don’t come from a long line of computer scientists, or even hold a computer science degree. I wasn’t hacking on computers when I was 12. We didn’t have one. I don’t have stickers on my laptop.

I have a BA in communication I got after leaving the Army. I chose it because I could pass.

In short, I’m not a natural to this world. 

I landed here through failure. My sister and I built an online business some years ago selling personal training over webcam. We started with zero knowledge of websites. I was a full-time student fresh out of my proudest days as a U.S Army Infantryman. She was a Holistic Health Coach. 

We ran out of money. Our developer (the Excellent [Matt McNeil](http://mattmacneil.com/)) took the site as far as the money would go. 

I started learning the basics of web development to keep the site going. We survived for a while, but couldn’t keep the lights on. 

The business shut down, but my web work didn’t. I got this taste of another life. 

I started a voracious regiment of self-teaching. I spent hours and hours a day on Khan Academy, Code Academy, any academy that could teach me something about the web.

A few years (and a few stumbles) later, I’m a senior frontend engineer at Wayfair.

This history gives me a permanent caveat to all future posts - I’m not an expert. I'll likely be wrong...a lot. I also hope to show others out there that backgrounds aren't fortune tellers. 

History can't be re-written, but futures can be re-directed. 

I hope by putting myself out there I invite critique. I hope I post something wrong and someone corrects me. I love corrections - it means I'm getting better.

In the end, I’m still trying to figure all this out. I’d like to try and figure it out together without ego.
